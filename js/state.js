// js/state/state.js - Application State Management (Central Re-exporter, temporarily commented out exports)

// Re-exporting all functions from the new, decomposed state modules
// TEMPORARILY COMMENTED OUT FOR DEBUGGING MIME TYPE ISSUE
// Because index.html is now loading them directly as non-modules,
// this file should NOT try to import/export them.
// export * from './projectState.js';
// export * from './trackState.js';
// export * from './windowState.js';
// export * from './appState.js';
// export * from './masterState.js';
// export * from './soundLibraryState.js';

// No internal state or logic remains in this file after decomposition
